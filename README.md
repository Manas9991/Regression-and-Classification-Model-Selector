# Regression-and-Classification-Model-Selector
Applies various Supervised classification or Regression Algorithms to cleaned data,
tunes them and tabulates performance metrics for user to choose the best model for their application.


Detailed Description:

The notebooks take in a dataset, which has to be cleaned and preprocessed by user in the notebook itself.
Next, they apply and tune (to some extent) various Machine learning algorithms for classification or regression, whichever is required by the user.
Then the algorithm's performance is evaluated using various metrics and the information is tabulated and presented
to the user for further application.

Models used for classification:

1) Logistic Regression
2) KNN
3) SVM
4) GuassianNB
5) Random Forest
6) Gradient Boosting

Metrics used for classification:

1) Accuracy
2) F1 score
3) Precision
4) Recall
5) Jaccard index

Models used for regression:

1) Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) XgBoost
4) AdaBoost
5) Lasso
6) Elastic Net
7) Ridge
8) RidgeCV
9) SGD Regressor
10) ARD Regressor
11) Huber Regressor
12) TheilSenRegressor

Metrics used for regression:

1) Mean Square Error
2) R2 score
3) Mean Absolute Error
4) Max Error

The notebooks save the user from time and effort of trying and evaluating various models.
Please feel free to make amendments to the code according to your application.
